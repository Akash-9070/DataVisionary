# Data Visualization Knowledge Hub

Welcome to **Data Visualization Knowledge Hub**! This repository encompasses everything I've learned about data visualization, covering a wide range of libraries and plots. The goal of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive resource for creating insightful visualizations across different domains of data.

## üñºÔ∏è Overview

Data visualization is the key to making data understandable, accessible, and actionable. In this repository, you will find:

- Tutorials and explanations of various **data visualization libraries**.
- Demonstrations of **all available plot types**, ranging from basic bar charts to advanced interactive visualizations.
- Examples showing how to effectively use data visualization to communicate insights.

## üìö Covered Libraries

This repository includes in-depth tutorials on the following libraries:

1. **Matplotlib**  
   The foundational library for static visualizations. Great for creating simple line graphs, bar charts, histograms, etc.

2. **Seaborn**  
   Built on top of Matplotlib, it simplifies complex visualizations with fewer lines of code.

3. **Plotly**  
   Focuses on interactive visualizations, allowing users to hover, zoom, and manipulate data points dynamically.



4. **ggplot2** (in Python via **Plotnine**)  
   Inspired by R‚Äôs ggplot2, it uses the Grammar of Graphics to create flexible visualizations.

5. **Pandas Plotting**  
   In-built plotting functions that integrate easily with DataFrames for quick and simple visualizations.


6. **Other Tools**  
    Additional tools like **Dash**, **Streamlit**, and **D3.js** for more advanced and web-based visualizations.

## üìä Plot Types

This repository also provides examples and explanations of all major plot types, including but not limited to:

1. **Line Plots**
2. **Bar Charts**
3. **Histograms**
4. **Scatter Plots**
5. **Box Plots**
6. **Violin Plots**
7. **Pie Charts**
8. **Heatmaps**
9. **Pair Plots**
10. **3D Plots**
11. **Geospatial Plots**
12. **Interactive Visualizations**
    - Interactive scatter plots, zoomable maps, dashboards, etc.

## üß† Learning Approach

Each section is structured as follows:

- **Concept Overview**: Introduction to the plot or library.
- **Code Snippets**: Practical code implementations.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world examples of how each visualization can be applied.
- **Customization**: Techniques to enhance, customize, and beautify your plots.
